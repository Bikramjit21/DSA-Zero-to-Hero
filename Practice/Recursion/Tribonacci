Problem Statement:
If you are coming to this problem, I hope you must have solved the fibonacci problem first.
So just like fibonacci series, here we have to print the sum of last three terms. 
It is a slight modification of the fibonacci series.

Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int trifibo(int n){
    if(n<=1){
        return n;
    }
    else{
        return trifibo(n-1)+trifibo(n-2)+trifibo(n-3);
    }
}
int main()
{
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    cout<<trifibo(n);
}
